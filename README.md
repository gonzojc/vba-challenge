# VBA Challenge - Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The project consisted of using Microsoft VBA to analyze stock data from 11 companies between 2017-2018 in order to determine which one was worth investing. The challenge was to take a previous VBA script and refactor it to decrease the amount of time it takes for the analysis to occur. 

## Results

The desired outcome was supposed to be similar and the refactored code was done to have it run faster. The information is supposed to contain the ticker, starting prince, ending price, and total volume. Overall, refactoring provided the same results with a decreased return time. The overall goal of the challege was to increase the effeciency of the oringnal code. The data for the 12 stocks contained the value, start/ending price, and the volume. Ultimately, the refactored code ran faster than the original code.

### Summary

1. Refactoring the original code ended up being much cleaner and streamlined in comparison. The advantages included faster run time, easier debugging, and faster troubleshooting. The newer code also seemed to be easier to read and adjust from the original. The macro run time was less than the original. Initially, there was a lot of troubleshooting when refactoring the original code. There was some additional research and review of the course material that assisted in completing the refactored code. \
2. The pros definitely outweight the cons. The same analysis was the outcome, but the overall macro rundown decreased by 50%.
